# Smart-Waste-Bin
A Smart Waste Bin using IoT automatically detects the waste level using ultrasonic sensors and sends data to the cloud. When the bin is full, it alerts the authorities through a mobile app. This system promotes efficient waste management, reduces manual monitoring, and helps keep the environment clean.
